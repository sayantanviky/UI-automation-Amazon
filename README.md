# UI-automation-Amazon
This is the UI automation on Amazon website. Here I have automated the activities like: 
1. Open the Amazon website
2. Find the search criteria and type "Camera" in it.
3. Then save the first 5 items with their price in the txt file and then closing the browser.

I have used Java selenium to automate the project. I have used dependencies to automate the functionalities and saved all those dependencies in pom.xml file. I have taken those dependencies from maven repository.
